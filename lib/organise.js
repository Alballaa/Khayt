/**
 * Two ways to organise a library of hundreds of things, and one vocabulary for
 * both screens.
 *
 * A shop asked for this as: "groups in files and catalogue so if I have a
 * collection I can group them, for example the Saudi Kings — and categories in
 * files and catalogue to better organise". Two different ideas, and the reason
 * both are needed is that they answer different questions:
 *
 *   A GROUP is a set that belongs together. The seven Saudi Kings are one
 *   collection. You look for the group when you want the set — to find all of
 *   it, or to offer all of it. A thing is in one group or none.
 *
 *   A CATEGORY is what a thing IS. Busts. Functional parts. Toys. You look for
 *   the category when you do not know what you want yet, which is exactly the
 *   state a library of hundreds puts you in.
 *
 * Tags are the third axis and already exist (lib/tags.js): free-form, many per
 * record, for everything that is neither of the above.
 *
 * ── GROUP IS THE FIELD THAT WAS CALLED FOLDER ──────────────────────────────
 * Print files already had `folder`: one name, one per record, typed into a box
 * — a set that belongs together, under a name a shop chose. That IS a group,
 * and re-filing every library to prove a point would be worse than useless.
 *
 * So nothing is migrated. `groupOf()` reads `group` and falls back to `folder`,
 * and `assign()` writes BOTH. The redundancy is deliberate and is the safety
 * property: renderer/bedready-library.js reads `.folder` directly, records
 * written by any earlier build have only `folder`, and a build without this
 * module still shows the right thing. Same discipline as `sourceFile` beside
 * `files[]` in lib/print-file-parts.js.
 *
 * ── ONE SPELLING EACH ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The rule from lib/tags.js applies with more force here, because these are
 * single-valued and drive a filter: "Saudi Kings" and "saudi kings" would be
 * two groups, each holding part of one collection, and the shop would have to
 * know which of them a given king went into. A name that matches one already in
 * use IS that name and adopts its spelling. Anything else is new and is kept
 * exactly as typed.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no fs, no Electron.

  /**
   * The name this record is filed under, whichever field holds it.
   *
   * ── `folder` WINS, AND THAT IS A SYNC DECISION ─────────────────────────────
   * `assign()` writes both fields to the same value, so on any record this app
   * has written they agree and the order would not matter. It matters for a shop
   * running TWO machines where only one has updated.
   *
   * Sync merges whole records, last-writer-wins (renderer/sync.js: `arr[i] =
   * incoming`), so a record edited on the older build arrives carrying every
   * field it does not understand — including `group`. And that build's edit
   * dialog writes `rec.folder` and nothing else. Reading `group` first therefore
   * meant: rename a group on the old laptop, sync, and the new machine goes on
   * showing the old name for ever, because its `group` is stale and wins.
   *
   * Reproduced before changing it — "Saudi Monarchs" on disk, "Saudi Kings" on
   * screen.
   *
   * So the field the OLDER build writes is the authority. The key's PRESENCE is
   * what decides, not its truthiness: a shop clearing the box on the old build
   * leaves `folder: ''`, and that empty string is the instruction.
   *
   * A product has no `folder` of its own — nothing before this ever filed one —
   * so it falls through to `group`.

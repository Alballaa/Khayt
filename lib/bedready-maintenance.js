 * BedReady's planned-downtime gate.
 *
 * While a migration is applied by hand to the live database, EVERY bedready.io
 * endpoint answers `503` with `error.code === "maintenance"` and a `Retry-After`
 * header. Reads included; `/auth` included.
 *
 * Khayt turned that into "Library fetch failed (HTTP 503)" — a shop told its
 * sync is broken, during a window in which nothing is broken and nothing was
 * half-written. Closing the door is what prevents a half-write.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENT 503s, AND ONLY ONE IS WORTH RETRYING. `unavailable` means the
 * server is misconfigured and will keep saying so. `maintenance` means come back
 * shortly. They share a status, so this branches on `error.code` — never on the
 * number, which is the same rule `mfa_required` needs against a plain `forbidden`.
 *
 * Pure: takes a status, a parsed body and a header getter. No fetch, no clock.

 * retrying by hand is not waiting on us.
 *
 * `Retry-After` may also carry an HTTP date. Both forms are accepted; a date is

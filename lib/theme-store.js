/**
 * Where an installed theme lives, and how it gets there.
 *
 * THE REASON THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * Khayt has been able to register a custom theme since the theme registry was
 * written. No user has ever done it, and none could: `themes/custom/index.json`
 * is inside `app.asar` — a read-only archive, replaced whole on every update. So
 * the only way to add a theme was to run from source, and the only way to keep
 * one was to never update. That is why the index still reads `{"themes": []}`.
 *
 * Themes belong in userData, next to the shop's own data: writable, and it
 * survives an update precisely because the installer does not own it.
 *
 * ONE FILE, NOT AN ARCHIVE
 *
 * A theme ships as a single JSON document carrying its manifest and its
 * stylesheets inline:
 *
 *     { "manifest": { "id": "my-shop", … }, "files": { "tokens.css": "…" } }
 *
 * A zip would have been the obvious choice and it is the wrong one. Unpacking
 * an archive from a stranger means owning zip-slip — an entry named
 * `../../../../etc/cron.d/x` that escapes the directory it is extracted into —
 * and that class of bug is subtle, well-known and entirely avoidable. JSON has
 * no notion of a path, so there is nothing to escape with: every filename is a
 * key this file checks before it becomes a filename.
 *
 * It is also the format a person can actually share. One file, readable, mailable,
 * diffable, and reviewable before installing by anyone who wants to look.
 *
 * PURE
 *
 * Decides paths and plans writes; performs none of them. The main process does
 * the I/O, so this is testable without touching a disk — and the containment
 * check below is the kind of thing that must be tested rather than reasoned about.

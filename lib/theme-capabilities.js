/**
 * What each dashboard layout actually answers, declared rather than discovered.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS FOR
 *
 * Khayt's eight themes are eight different screens, deliberately — Flow is a
 * kanban, Meridian a schedule, Foreman a wallboard, Command and Vivid lead with
 * figures, Workbench leads with the work. That is the feature and it stays.
 *
 * What is NOT a feature is that switching theme silently changes what you can
 * see. Average margin appears on two layouts of eight. Revenue on three. A shop
 * that picked Workbench because it liked the look has no way to know it gave up
 * the margin figure, and no way to find out except to install another theme.
 *
 * Worse, a deliberate omission and an accidental one look identical. Workbench
 * dropping the revenue tiles is a considered decision and its source says so at
 * length — where every number went, and that "this is a move and not a
 * deletion". Nothing else in the codebase records that, so the reasoning lives
 * in a comment that no test reads and no user ever sees.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT
 *
 * It is a declaration, not a derivation. A theme says what it shows and what it
 * deliberately leaves out, and the test below insists every capability is
 * addressed one way or the other — so a gap has to be an answer rather than a
 * silence. It does not force any theme to show anything.
 *
 * A missing REASON is recorded as null rather than invented. Four of the six
 * custom layouts never wrote down why they omit what they omit, and putting
 * plausible words in their author's mouth would defeat the point of writing it
 * down at all. `unexplainedOmissions()` reports them, and the test surfaces the
 * count without failing — the same shape as the locale orphan report.
 *
 * SEEDED FROM WHAT THE CODE RENDERS, NOT FROM MEMORY
 *
 * Every `shows` entry below was verified against the label the layout actually
 * renders, and `test/theme-capabilities.test.js` re-checks that claim so the
 * manifest cannot quietly start lying.
 */

/**
 * The capabilities a dashboard can answer.
 *
 * Deliberately small and entirely verified. Anything that could not be confirmed
 * from a rendered label was left out rather than guessed at — a registry that
 * is half-true is worse than one that is short.

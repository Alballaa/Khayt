/**
 * Planning what comes out of a dropped .zip.
 *
 * Model packs arrive as archives — a Google Drive download, a Patreon bundle, a
 * MakerWorld pack — and Khayt could not open one. Every file had to be unzipped
 * by hand first, into a folder, and dragged in one at a time.
 *
 * This decides WHAT to take. lib/zip-read.js does the reading (dependency-free,
 * central-directory driven, never throws) and main.js does the writing. Keeping
 * the decision here is what lets the nasty cases be tested without a real
 * archive on disk.
 *
 * The three that matter, in order of how badly they end:
 *
 *   ZIP SLIP     A member is named `../../../.ssh/authorized_keys`. Joining that
 *                onto a destination writes outside it. The defence here is not
 *                sanitising the path — it is refusing to use the member's path
 *                AT ALL. Only the basename survives, so there is nothing left to
 *                traverse with.
 *   ZIP BOMB     A few KB inflating to gigabytes. zip-read caps each member;
 *                this caps the CUMULATIVE total and the member count, the same
 *                way lib/mf-convert.js does for a multi-entry 3MF.
 *   SILENT LOSS  A budget that drops files without saying so. mf-convert learned
 *                this from a real 229 MB poster that lost an object to a limit
 *                nobody was told about. Everything not taken comes back in
 *                `skipped` with a reason, and hitting a cap sets `truncated`.
 *
 * Pure: no fs, no zlib, no DOM.

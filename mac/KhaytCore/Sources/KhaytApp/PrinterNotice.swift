/// The reason an app like this is worth leaving open. Khayt sends these through
/// Telegram, email or a webhook — transports for somebody who is not in the
/// workshop. This one is for the person who is: a notification on the machine
/// they are sitting at, which arrives whether or not the shop has ever set up a
/// bot.
///
/// **It does not deliver in a development run**, and that is deliberate rather
/// than a gap. `UNUserNotificationCenter.current()` traps when the process has
/// no bundle identifier, which `swift run` does not — so it would take the
/// whole app down, including the snapshot harness, for a notification nobody
/// would see. The alerts are still computed and still recorded; only the
/// delivery is skipped.

/**
 * How many hours a shop prints on each day of the week, by default.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The default was written out as an object literal in four places —
 * renderer/app-state.js, twice in renderer/app-helpers.js, and
 * renderer/machines.js — and all four said:
 *
 *     { mon: 8, tue: 8, wed: 8, thu: 8, fri: 0, sat: 0, sun: 0 }
 *
 * That is a FOUR-DAY WEEK, and it matches no working week anywhere. The Gulf
 * works Sunday to Thursday with a Friday–Saturday weekend; most of Europe and
 * the Americas work Monday to Friday. This is neither: it takes the Gulf's
 * weekend and then loses Sunday as well, which reads like a Western Sunday-off
 * left in place when Friday and Saturday were zeroed.
 *
 * It is not cosmetic. These hours feed avgDailyWorkingHours(), the due-date
 * suggestion on an order, the machine queue-clear date and the schedule
 * projection — so a shop that never opened Working Hours had every one of those
 * computed against four days instead of five, and quoted dates further out than
 * it needed to. Lead time errs late ON PURPOSE, through a safety margin the shop
 * can see and change; a missing working day is not that, it is arithmetic
 * quietly disagreeing with the calendar.
 *
 * Khayt's primary market is Saudi Arabia — ZATCA invoicing, Arabic-first, Salla
 * and Zid — and the existing Friday–Saturday weekend says the Gulf week was the
 * intent. So Sunday is restored and the default is Sunday to Thursday.
 *
 * A shop that has already set its own hours is untouched: this is only the
 * fallback for a `settings.workingHours` that was never written.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no fs, no Electron.

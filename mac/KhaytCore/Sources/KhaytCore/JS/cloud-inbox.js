 * The other direction from `lib/cloud-outbox.js`, and the dangerous one: the
 * outbox appends to a chain nobody has to obey, while this REPLACES records in
 * a shop's own book. Everything here was `pullMerge` in
 * `renderer/cloud-sync.js` plus a constant in `renderer/settings.js`, which
 * between them meant a second host could not merge without writing the rule a
 * second time — and a second opinion about which of two edits wins is the one
 * thing sync must never have.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH. `extractDeltas` walks array collections and
 * tombstones and nothing else, so **settings never come down**. That is not an
 * oversight to be fixed later: a shop's cloud address, its tax registration and
 * its printer addresses belong to the machine in front of you, and a merge that
 * quietly replaced them would be the worst kind of surprise. The desktop has
 * always behaved this way; saying so here is the point.

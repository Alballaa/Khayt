/// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR: the store keeps `settings.telegram.botToken` as
/// `__enc__` + OSCrypt, this app read the store raw, and `tell` handed that
/// string to `Telegram.send` as a bot token. `isBotToken` refused it, so every
/// shop with Telegram configured was told its message did not go out — every
/// time, since the day it shipped. `SafeStorage.open` existed and was tested;
/// nothing called it.
///
/// This shop's own book has an empty `botToken`, which is why the path never
/// failed here and the bug survived a release.
///
/// **NOTHING HERE MAY TOUCH THE LOGIN KEYCHAIN.** The first version of this
/// file did, and macOS put a SecurityAgent dialog on screen and the test
/// process waited on it for ever — no output, no timeout, killed by hand.
/// `Secrets.keySource` is the seam that keeps the suite off it.
/// SERIALIZED: `Secrets` keeps the session's key in static storage, and Swift
/// Testing runs a suite's tests in parallel — so the "locked Keychain" case
/// substituted a nil key source out from under the round-trip case, which then
/// failed for a reason that had nothing to do with it.

# Khayt for macOS — native

A native Mac app, replacing the Electron build **on macOS only**. Windows and
Linux stay on Electron: this exists because Electron cannot be made to feel like
a Mac app, not because the Electron app is going away.

## The architecture, and why

Khayt is ~97,000 lines of JavaScript. This does not rewrite all of it.

| | Lines | Here |
|---|---|---|
| Pure `lib/` — tax, pricing, payment plans, split-order, loyalty, estimator | 29,121 | **reused**, run in JavaScriptCore |
| `renderer/` — the interface | 52,855 | **rewritten** in SwiftUI. This is the point of the exercise |
| `main.js` — 192 IPC handlers | 5,904 | rewritten in Swift |
| Impure `lib/` — store-io, printer protocols, LAN server | 9,583 | rewritten in Swift |

**The business logic is not rewritten, and that is deliberate.** macOS ships
JavaScriptCore as a system framework, so those modules run here unchanged, with
nothing bundled and no Node. A Swift `computeTax` would earn the right to be
wrong in a second, different way, and every future fix would have to be made
twice — in an app whose whole recent history is money bugs found one at a time.

Proven, not assumed:

```
                Swift (JavaScriptCore)     Node              match
tax         →   347826.08 / 52173.92       same              ✓
instalments →   [666.67, 666.67, 666.66]   same              ✓
quote total →   187.5                      same              ✓
```

`MoneyParityTests` runs every case a review pass got wrong — the nil VAT return,
exclusive pricing, the instalment remainder, the split-order deposit, the
customer progress tracker — through both engines and compares the values.

## Layout

```
mac/
  KhaytCore/           Swift package: the JS bridge + typed money API
    Sources/…/JS/      copies of lib/*.js  ← never edit; run mac/sync-js.sh
  sync-js.sh           re-copy from lib/
```

## The copies are guarded twice

SPM resources must live inside the package, so `JS/` holds copies of `lib/`.
That is a fork waiting to happen, so:

* `test/mac-core-is-not-a-fork.test.js` — byte comparison, runs on Linux CI, free.
* `MoneyParityTests` — the same check *plus* Swift-vs-Node values. Needs macOS,
  so it is not in CI: a macOS runner bills at 10×, which is a decision rather
  than a detail. Run it locally before touching anything in `lib/`.

```bash
cd mac/KhaytCore && swift test
```

## Not yet built

The store, the platform layer, and every screen. `KhaytCore` is the foundation
they all sit on, and it is first because the alternative — screens against a
half-trusted engine — is how the two apps come to disagree about a shop's money.

## The one hard constraint

**Only one app may own the store at a time.** Khayt's write serialisation is
per-process: two processes on one `khayt-store.json` race exactly the way two
shop-floor tablets did before #898. Either the Mac app replaces Electron on that
machine, or the second one opens read-only behind a lock.

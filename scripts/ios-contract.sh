# Prove the iOS companion can still read the desktop.

# Two halves that can drift apart silently:
#   lib/lan-server.js  — what the desktop sends
#   ios/…/KhaytModels.swift — what the phone requires
#
# The phone decodes with Swift `Codable`, which THROWS on a missing required
# field. So renaming one key is not a degraded screen on the phone, it is an
# empty one — and nothing else in the repo notices: `npm test` passes,
# `xcodebuild` passes, and neither one ever puts the two sides in a room.
#
# This boots the real server, captures the real bytes, and decodes them with the
# real structs. Verified by mutation: renaming `completed_today` to
# `completedToday` in lan-server.js makes it fail with keyNotFound, as it should.

/**
 * The release docs must not lie about which release is current.
 *
 * On 2026-08-27, four files claimed four different things at once:
 *
 *   ROADMAP.md            named beta.9 as newest published in one paragraph and
 *                         beta.8 in the next — and the commit that "fixed" that
 *                         duplication a week earlier had introduced it again,
 *                         by rewriting the stale paragraph instead of removing it
 *   docs/RELEASE-HOLD.md  said all three manifests read 3.7.0-beta.8 after the
 *                         beta.9 publish; two of them read beta.9
 *   VERSIONING.md         still called beta.3 the latest — six cuts behind
 *   docs/BETA-RELEASE.md  still said beta.6 — four cuts behind
 *
 * None of that is carelessness. It is that ONE fact — which release is current —
 * is written out in prose in five places, and prose does not fail a build. Every
 * one of those four was found by a human re-reading the files at cut time, which
 * is the most expensive way to find them and the one most likely to be skipped.
 *
 * ── What this checks, and what it deliberately does not ─────────────────────
 *
 * These files are full of legitimate references to old versions: shipped tables,
 * "the 3.6.0 line ran beta.1–beta.19", the beta.4 trap. Flagging every mention of
 * an old version would fail on every honest history paragraph, so this does not
 * do that. It checks four narrow properties instead, each one traceable to a real
 * defect above:
 *
 *   1. Each file NAMES the version in package.json. A file that has never heard
 *      of the release being cut cannot be current. Catches VERSIONING (six cuts
 *      behind) and BETA-RELEASE (four).
 *   2. No file names a PRERELEASE ON THE CURRENT LINE that is newer than
 *      package.json — a doc that has run ahead of the bump, which is how a
 *      release gets announced before it can exist. Deliberately scoped to the
 *      open line: these files also name the line's own target (`3.7.0`, which
 *      semver ranks above every `3.7.0-beta.N`), the bump table's hypothetical
 *      `4.0.0`, and Electron's `42.8.1`. None of those is a claim about a Khayt
 *      release, and flagging them taught the first draft of this check to cry
 *      wolf on six lines of correct prose.
 *   3. "newest published" is claimed AT MOST ONCE PER FILE. Catches the ROADMAP
 *      defect directly: the rule that kept being broken is that a cut replaces
 *      that paragraph rather than writing a new one above it.
 *   4. All such claims, across all files, name the SAME version. Two files
 *      quietly disagreeing is the same defect spread out far enough that nobody
 *      reading either one notices.
 *   5. The same, for BED READY's separate `1.x` line — see below.
 *   6. All four files agree on which release is STABLE, and it is never newer
 *      than package.json. Rules 3 and 4 guard the pre-release claim; this is the
 *      same fact for the other channel, and it is the one that will drift on
 *      PROMOTION DAY — four files each carrying "Stable is v3.6.0" in their own
 *      wording, all of which have to change at once, on the day these documents
 *      matter most and the person doing it is thinking about the release.
 *
 * ── Bed Ready needs its own rule, and a different one ──────────────────────
 *
 * Bed Ready ships from this repo on an independent `1.x` line, and its version
 * is NOT in package.json: it is typed into a workflow input at release time and
 * committed nowhere. So rules 1 and 2 have nothing to compare against, and the
 * only property left is the one that actually rots — ROADMAP.md and
 * VERSIONING.md each state the current Bed Ready release in prose, and after a
 * cut one of them gets updated.
 *
 * The rule is therefore: the HIGHEST Bed Ready version named in each file that
 * names any must be the same. Highest rather than "all of them", because both
 * files legitimately talk about older releases — 1.0.0's nine-day gap,
 * VERSIONING's own `bedready-v1.0.0` updater-trap paragraph, and an example
 * command that types `1.0.1`. Those are history and instruction, not claims.
 *
 * Every `1.x.y` in these files is Bed Ready's, because Khayt is on `3.x`. That
 * is checked rather than assumed: a Khayt version can never match `^1\.`.
 *
 * "Highest wins" leans on one property of how these files are written: both
 * state the version they chose ALONGSIDE the one they rejected — "1.2.0 rather
 * than 1.1.1", "1.1.0 rather than 1.0.1" — and the rejected one is always the
 * SMALLER, because the justification is always for taking a bigger bump than the
 * obvious one. If that ever inverts, this rule reads the rejected number as the
 * claim. Say it the same way round and it does not.
 *
 * It does NOT reach the network. Whether the tag was actually pushed and the
 * manifests actually serve is a different question with a different answer at
 * different moments, and CI is the wrong place to ask it — `gh release list` and
 * a fetched manifest are, at cut time. This checks internal consistency only:
 * that the repo agrees with itself.

/**
 * A delete has to travel as a FACT, not just as an effect.
 *
 * `applyDeltas` used to carry out an incoming delete and move on: the record was
 * removed, and nothing recorded that a delete had happened. The receiving device
 * therefore had no tombstone, so when a third device that had not yet seen the
 * delete pushed the record, the unseen-record branch accepted it — there was
 * nothing to refuse it with. Meanwhile the device that pressed delete does hold
 * the tombstone and stays deleted. Two devices disagree, permanently, and neither
 * has any way to notice.
 *
 * The earlier resurrection fix (test/resurrected-records.test.js) made the
 * DELETING device immune by consulting its own tombstones. That defence is worth
 * nothing on a device that was never given one.
 *
 * Found by building the three-device case while writing the org integration
 * tests, and confirmed by running it — two devices ending up with different
 * record sets — before any of this was changed.

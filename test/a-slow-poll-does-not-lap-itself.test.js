/**
 * A printer poll that outruns its own interval used to lap itself.
 *
 * `setInterval(poll, 30000)` does not wait for an async callback, and a poll is
 * SEQUENTIAL: one `fetchPrinterStatus` per machine, each with a 5-second
 * timeout. Seven machines that do not answer — a shop whose printers are off
 * overnight — take 35 seconds, so the next tick fires 5 seconds before the
 * previous poll has finished, and from then on they stack.
 *
 * Two polls in flight both read `before` from printerStatusCache and both write
 * it back. Measured against the real merge functions:
 *
 *     completion seen by the poll that read the fresh state : true
 *     completion seen by the poll that read a STALE state   : false
 *
 * That edge out of printing is the only moment a job's measured filament and
 * duration are true — the printer's counters reset when the next job starts. So
 * losing the race loses the measurement, silently, which is the same data
 * `printerCompletions` was rescued for in #900.

/**
 * Percentage fees, as wired through the app.
 *
 * lib/pricing.js is where the arithmetic is tested. What can only go wrong here
 * is that one of the OTHER places that price a job does not know about them —
 * and every one of those failures is a wrong number that still looks plausible:
 *
 *   1. The logged order. renderer/order-flows.js used to re-derive the price
 *      itself, summing `l.amount` — which a percentage line does not have. A
 *      quote shown as 132 was logged as 120, and nothing anywhere disagreed.
 *      That block was also the "second implementation" lib/pricing.js was
 *      extracted to prevent.
 *   2. The invoice. It renders `l.amount`, so a percentage line would print as
 *      0.00 on the document the customer actually receives.
 *   3. The order editor, which edits `amount` in place. Leaving a stale `pct`
 *      beside an edited amount means the invoice shows one number and any
 *      re-quote computes another.

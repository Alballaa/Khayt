 * Splitting a job across machines billed it twice and lost the deposit.
 *
 * `splitOrderAcrossMachines` creates one sub-order per machine, each carrying a
 * proportional share of the price, and leaves the parent behind with
 * `status:'split'` and its FULL PRICE INTACT.
 *
 * Nothing excluded that parent from the money. Receivables is filtered on
 * payment status alone — deliberately "regardless of status", because a job can
 * be owed for at any stage — so the parent's debt and the children's debt were
 * both counted. Measured before the fix:
 *
 *     one SAR 3,000 job, SAR 1,000 deposit taken, then split in two
 *       receivables shown : 5000.00
 *       actually owed     : 2000.00
 *
 * And every sub-order was created `paidAmount: 0`, so the deposit did not
 * travel: the customer was invoiced for the full value a second time.

/**
 * A workflow file that does not parse is a zero-second red build.
 *
 * GitHub does not tell you it is a syntax error — the run appears, fails in 0s
 * with no job output, and `gh pr checks` reports "no checks reported on the
 * branch", which reads like CI has not started yet rather than like a mistake.
 *
 * The specific trap, hit while adding the keyboard e2e step:
 *
 *     - name: E2E smoke (keyboard: modal focus, trap, Escape)
 *
 * An unquoted `: ` inside a YAML scalar starts a mapping, so the step — and the
 * whole file — fails to parse. Quoting the value fixes it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a real YAML parse: js-yaml is not a declared devDependency
 * here (it is only transitively present), and a guard that depends on a package
 * nobody installed on purpose is the kind that breaks on a clean `npm ci` for
 * reasons unrelated to what it checks. This tests the one hazard that has
 * actually bitten, with no dependencies at all.

 * `latest-linux.yml`. The app checks for updates on every platform with no
 * gating, so on Linux that check asked for a file that was not there. Nothing
 * failed loudly; Linux users were simply never offered an update, for three
 * releases.
 *
 * `never` is legitimate for a store package, which the store updates. So this
 * follows the same shape as the other allowlists in this suite: permitted, but
 * only with a reason written down next to it.

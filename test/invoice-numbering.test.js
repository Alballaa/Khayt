/**
 * Invoice and quote numbering.
 *
 * Under ZATCA — Saudi Arabia's e-invoicing mandate, and this product's primary
 * market — an invoice number has to be unique and the sequence has to be
 * unbroken. A duplicate is not a cosmetic glitch; it is a compliance failure on
 * a document the shop has already handed to a customer, and it cannot be
 * corrected by editing the record afterwards.
 *
 * The ZATCA TLV and XML builders were covered. The thing that decides what goes
 * ON the invoice was not: `nextInvoiceNumber()` and `nextQuoteSeq()` had no
 * tests at all. No defect was found writing these — they are here because
 * "correct today" and "guarded" are different things, and this is code where the
 * cost of a regression is measured in tax filings.

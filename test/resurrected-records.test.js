/**
 * Finding the records the old sync bug brought back.
 *
 * v3.3.0 and every 3.4 beta shipped a merge that re-added records the store had
 * already deleted (see test/cloud-sync.test.js). The fix stops new cases and can
 * do nothing about the ones already saved to disk, so the app has to be able to
 * say "these came back" rather than leaving a shop to notice on its own.
 *
 * The whole approach rests on one claim, so it is worth testing rather than
 * asserting: a store holding BOTH a tombstone for an id AND a live record with
 * that id cannot arise legitimately. Ids are never derived from external data
 * (`ensureId` and `uniqueLanId` are timestamp+random), there is no undo-delete,
 * and no restore path merges records back in. The tests below cover the normal
 * lifecycles that might plausibly produce a false positive.

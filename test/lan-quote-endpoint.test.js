/**
 * POST /api/quote — costing a part from the phone.
 *
 * A customer walks in holding a part. Today that means walking back to the
 * desktop, which is why quoting was the strongest of the phone-feature
 * candidates: it is revenue, and it happens standing up.
 *
 * The design constraint that shapes everything here: the phone must never
 * produce a different number from the desktop it is paired to. So the endpoint
 * calls the desktop's own `renderer/calculator-cost.js` against the live store
 * rather than reimplementing the maths server-side. Two implementations means
 * two costs for one part, and the wrong one is whichever the shop happens to be
 * looking at.
 *
 * The tests boot the real server and speak HTTP to it. Asserting against the
 * calculator directly would prove the calculator works — which is already known
 * — and nothing about the endpoint, its auth, or its handling of a hostile body.

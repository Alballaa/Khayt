/**
 * Two ways a locale bundle passes every existing gate and is still wrong.
 *
 * `locale-parity.test.js` proves every English key EXISTS in every language and
 * that its {placeholders} survive. Neither says anything about the value. A
 * bundle can be at full parity and still show a German user an English
 * sentence, because the "translation" is the English string copied across.
 *
 * Found by auditing rather than by anyone reporting it: 40 keys were sitting in
 * de/es/fr/zh as untouched English — the whole CSV import dialog, the resin
 * calculator's fields, the order status page, the waste report. Nothing was
 * broken, nothing threw, and every gate was green.
 *
 * The second one is smaller and stranger. Fifty-six English values carry a
 * glyph of their own — "+ Add Client", "✓ Paid", "← Back" — because the markup
 * does not supply an icon for them. Where a translator dropped that glyph, the
 * same button gained or lost a "+" depending on the language. Eight keys had
 * done exactly that.
 *
 * ── WHY THE GLYPHS ARE NOT SIMPLY DELETED ──────────────────────────────────
 * They are doing real work: nothing else marks those buttons as "add". Moving
 * them into the markup as icons is the right end state and is a separate piece
 * of work; until then the requirement is that every language shows the SAME
 * button. What is not acceptable is a glyph in some languages and not others.

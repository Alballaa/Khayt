/**
 * Everything added in this release is REACHABLE.
 *
 * The recurring failure in this repo is not a wrong module — it is a right
 * module with no caller: a script tag never added, a report nothing surfaces, a
 * helper the save path does not consult. Unit tests pass either way, because in
 * Node the require() always succeeds. #578 was that, the print-file preview
 * migration was that, and lib/split-order.js would have been that this morning
 * if the <script> guard had not caught it.
 *
 * So: one place that names every new seam and asserts something calls it.
 * Deleting a call site fails here, which is the only thing that makes the rest
 * of the suite mean anything.

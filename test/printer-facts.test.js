/**
 * The printer catalog's checked facts, and the two things it used to get wrong.
 *
 * `extruder` had exactly two values, 'direct' and 'bowden'. A toolchanger is
 * neither, so the Snapmaker U1 — four toolheads, five-second swaps — was
 * recorded as "direct", and so was the Prusa XL with up to five independent
 * toolheads. The field read as an answer and was not one.
 *
 * There was no nozzle material at all, which is the single field the wear model
 * most needs: a Bambu X1C ships hardened steel and a Prusa MK4S ships brass, a
 * ten-fold difference in expected life, and both were handed the same default.
 *
 * Everything asserted here is a DEFAULT. The machine editor writes these into a
 * form the shop can overwrite; nothing in the catalog constrains a machine.

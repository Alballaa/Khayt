/**
 * A print made of several files, as wired in.
 *
 * lib/print-file-parts.js has been right and unreachable since it was written:
 * `partsOf` was read for the size chip and nothing else, so a Spiderman was
 * still twelve entries and there was no way to make it one. That is this
 * codebase's signature failure — a module that is correct, tested, and plugged
 * into nothing — and this file exists to make it impossible here.
 *
 * What it pins is the plumbing, not the arithmetic:
 *
 *   1. Every one of the module's verbs is REACHED from the renderer. A verb no
 *      caller uses is a feature nobody can get to.
 *   2. Opening a multi-part print opens ALL of it. Four `spawn`s would be four
 *      slicer windows each holding one limb; the whole print goes as ONE command
 *      with several arguments, and the old single-path shape still works for
 *      the callers that mean exactly one file.
 *   3. No part launches without being confined and rehydrated FIRST. A slicer
 *      that came up holding three quarters of a print, with the fourth silently
 *      dropped, is how you print a Spiderman with one arm.
 *   4. The archive question is asked, and closing it imports nothing rather
 *      than picking an answer.

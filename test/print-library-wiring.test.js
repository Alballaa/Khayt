/**
 * The library can live elsewhere, and every path that touches it must agree.
 *
 * Three things go wrong quietly here, so each is pinned:
 *
 *   1. A confinement check written against ONE root. Every handler confines
 *      paths to the library; if that means "under the current root" then moving
 *      the library makes yesterday's files unreadable rather than merely
 *      relocated.
 *   2. A read that throws. Writes must refuse loudly when the share is away, but
 *      a READ that throws turns "no files here" into an unhandled rejection in
 *      every caller that only wanted to know whether a record has a file —
 *      resolveModelPath() does not catch.
 *   3. A button with no listener, or a function the other IIFE cannot see.
 *      settings.js only exposes what is in its `api` object, and wire-events.js
 *      guards with typeof — so an unexported function is a control that renders
 *      and silently does nothing. This codebase has shipped that before.

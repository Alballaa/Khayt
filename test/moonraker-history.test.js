/**
 * The printer's own job history, and why the nozzle counter needed it.
 *
 * Khayt's print log is a BUSINESS record — orders, with a client and a price. A
 * printer runs far more than orders: test prints, reprints, calibration, and
 * everything nobody paid for. All of it is real filament through the same
 * nozzle.
 *
 * Measured on a real machine: the order log accounted for 2,461 g since the
 * nozzle went in, and the printer's own history said 4,980 g — against a 2,000 g
 * threshold. The warning was firing late, which ruins parts rather than wasting
 * nozzles.

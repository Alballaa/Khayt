/**
 * lib/stl-estimate.js — the geometry-based weight and time estimate.
 *
 * This file had no tests, which is how the shell model stayed wrong through a
 * release. The arithmetic was self-consistent: `shellFactor` was a constant
 * fraction of volume, every expression using it agreed, and a fixture written
 * from the same assumption would have confirmed it forever.
 *
 * What it could not survive is a question about PHYSICS. Walls scale with
 * surface area (L²) and the part with volume (L³), so the shell's share of a
 * part must FALL as the part gets bigger. A constant cannot do that at two
 * sizes at once, and the old default — right at roughly calibration-cube size —
 * quoted a 100 mm cube at 613 g against a physical ~327 g.
 *
 * So these tests assert against values computed from first principles here, not
 * against recorded output.

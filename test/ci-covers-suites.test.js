/**
 * A test suite nobody runs is a file that looks like coverage and is not.
 *
 * `npm test` runs the UNIT suite only — `node --test test/*.test.js`. Every e2e
 * suite is a separate npm script that runs ONLY if ci.yml names it, so adding
 * `test:e2e:whatever` to package.json and stopping there produces a suite that
 * never executes, passes review, and protects nothing. It cannot fail, so it
 * never tells anyone it is not running.
 *
 * Found on 2026-08-28, before a release: two suites were in that state.
 * `test:e2e:consumables` and — the one that matters — `test:e2e:cloudstorage`,
 * which covers print-library tiering: the 3.7.0 line's headline feature and the
 * only deliberately destructive thing in the print library, since it MOVES a
 * shop's files off its disk. Both passed when finally run; the suites were fine,
 * they were simply never asked anything.
 *
 * This is the same defect as the rest of that week in a different costume: a
 * guard that silently is not a guard.

/**
 * `test:e2e:all` is not a suite. It RUNS the suites — locally, in one command,

 *
 * It exists because the same defect this file is about bit again from the other
 * side: forty-five e2e suites, and it is far too easy to run two of them, see
 * two greens and push. A change that moved order creation into a shared module
 * reached CI with `NewOrderRules is not defined` — caught by `test:e2e:qc`, and
 * by nothing else that had been run.
 *
 * Excluded from the coverage check rather than added to ci.yml: CI already runs
 * every suite by name, and naming this one too would run all forty-five a second
 * time. Its own test below proves it actually covers them.

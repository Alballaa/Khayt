/**
 * A modal opened inside onSave is destroyed by the close that follows it.
 *
 * `openFormModal` (renderer/shell.js) renders into ONE shared `#modalMount`, and
 * its private close() does `mount.innerHTML = ''`. The save handler is:
 *
 *     const result = await onSave(modal);
 *     if (result !== false) close();
 *
 * So any modal opened from inside onSave is wiped the instant onSave returns
 * true. Nothing throws. The second modal simply never appears.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical: it was written after the organisation flow did
 * exactly that and silently swallowed the org RECOVERY KEY — shown once, never
 * re-issued, and the only spare way into every branch. Running the app is what
 * found it; no unit test could have, because the code was correct in isolation.
 *
 * The fix is to defer past the close (`setTimeout(..., 0)`) or to open the modal
 * from a plain click handler instead, which is what the shop signup already does.

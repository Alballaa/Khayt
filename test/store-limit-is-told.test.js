 * The screen that reports the data file must not deny the limit exists.

 * Settings said, in green, with a tick:
 *
 *     No size limit — file-based storage ✓
 *
 * There is a limit. main.js refuses to WRITE a store over 50 MB
 * (`hub:save-store`) and refuses to READ one (`recoverStoreRaw(50_000_000)`).
 * Past that line every save fails: the shop gets a toast, carries on working,
 * and loses the day at the next launch.
 *
 * A shop with a few thousand print files was reaching it — previews were about
 * nine tenths of what a record cost — and the one screen they would look at to
 * find out told them the opposite, in the colour that means "fine".
 *
 * The claim and the enforcement are read from the two files here, so they cannot
 * drift apart again: change the ceiling in main.js and this fails until the
 * screen agrees.

/**
 * The IPC channel list is maintained by hand in two places: preload.js names
 * the channels the renderer may reach, and main.js (plus the lib/ modules it
 * delegates to) registers the handlers. A typo on either side fails SILENTLY —
 * `ipcRenderer.invoke` on an unhandled channel rejects at runtime, in a code
 * path that may only run for one shop with one feature enabled.
 *
 * Honest note: when this test was written the surface was already fully
 * consistent — 170 invoke channels, 151 handlers in main.js and the rest in
 * lib/ modules, with zero mismatches in either direction. It found nothing.
 * It exists because every OTHER hand-maintained list in this codebase had
 * drifted by the time anyone checked (the 153-file lint chain, settings.js's
 * export literal, the per-flavor CSS tokens), and this one is only consistent
 * until the next channel is added.

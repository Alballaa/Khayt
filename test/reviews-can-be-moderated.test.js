/**
 * A review was permanent and invisible.
 *
 * Anyone who could reach POST /v1/shops/{id}/reviews could leave one, and every
 * one of them counted toward `avg` — the star rating the storefront prints:
 *
 *     if (d && d.count > 0) $('#shopRating').textContent = `★ ${d.avg} (${d.count})`;
 *
 * The cloud had no DELETE route and no hidden flag; the desktop showed only the
 * aggregate and a "copy review link" button. So a shop could watch its public
 * rating fall, could not see which reviews were doing it, and could not remove
 * any of them. Rate limiting bounds one address at ten an hour; it bounds
 * nothing in aggregate, and it does not help at all once a review is written.
 *
 * The cloud half is covered by the contract suite against BOTH backends. This is
 * the desktop half — the part that would otherwise be a route nobody calls.

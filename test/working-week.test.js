/**
 * The default working week, and why it was wrong.
 *
 * `{ mon: 8, tue: 8, wed: 8, thu: 8, fri: 0, sat: 0, sun: 0 }` was written out in
 * FIVE places — app-state, twice in app-helpers, machines and settings. It is a
 * four-day week and matches no working week anywhere: the Gulf works Sunday to
 * Thursday with a Friday–Saturday weekend, and most of Europe and the Americas
 * work Monday to Friday. This is neither — it takes the Gulf's weekend and loses
 * Sunday as well, which reads like a Western Sunday-off left in place when
 * Friday and Saturday were zeroed.
 *
 * Not cosmetic: these hours feed avgDailyWorkingHours(), the due-date suggestion
 * on an order, the machine queue-clear date and the schedule projection. A shop
 * that never opened Working Hours had all four computed against four days
 * instead of five, and quoted dates further out than it needed to. Lead time
 * errs late on purpose through a visible safety margin; a missing working day is
 * not that.

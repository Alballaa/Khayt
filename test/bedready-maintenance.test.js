/**
 * BedReady's planned-downtime gate.
 *
 * While a migration is applied by hand to the live database, every bedready.io
 * endpoint answers 503 with `error.code === "maintenance"` and a `Retry-After`
 * header — reads included, /auth included.
 *
 * Khayt reported that as "Library fetch failed (HTTP 503)": a shop told its sync
 * is broken, during a window in which nothing is broken and nothing was
 * half-written.
 *
 * The distinction that has to hold: 503 is ALSO `unavailable`, which means a
 * misconfigured server that retrying will not fix. Same status, opposite advice
 * — so the branch is on `error.code`, exactly as `mfa_required` must be branched
 * against a plain `forbidden`.
 *
 * The second half of this file drives the real client functions against a real
 * local HTTP server, because "does it read the header off the response" is not
 * something a unit test of a pure function can answer.

/**
 * A quote that leaves the quote column has been accepted.
 *
 * `quoteAcceptedAt` was written by exactly ONE path — the Approve button in
 * the invoicing screen. A shop that drags the card to Pending, or picks
 * Pending from the Job menu, or moves it on the Mac app's board, moved the
 * quote without stamping anything. The field is what the quote conversion
 * rate is computed from, so every quote won by dragging counted as a quote
 * never accepted: a shop that works from the board saw a conversion rate that
 * only ever fell.
 *
 * A DELIBERATE CHANGE to lib/order-status.js, so it has its own tests here.

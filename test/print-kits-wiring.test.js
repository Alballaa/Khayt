/**
 * Kits, as wired into the print log.
 *
 * lib/print-kits.js is where the totalling is tested. What can only go wrong
 * here is the plumbing, and three of those failures are quiet enough to ship:
 *
 *   1. A kit that does not survive a Settings save. `settings` is REBUILT from
 *      the form by saveSettingsFromForm(), so anything written elsewhere is
 *      dropped unless it is carried across explicitly — silently, on the next
 *      unrelated visit to Settings. printLibrary carries a comment about exactly
 *      this; kits is the second field to need it.
 *   2. A rollup shown without saying how much of it was measured. The whole
 *      point of lib/print-kits.js is that a total can omit jobs; printing the
 *      total and hiding the count puts the bug back at the last step.
 *   3. A button wired to a function the other IIFE cannot see, or a listener
 *      bound to a node that is re-rendered out from under it.
